# UART Project Part 1
Part 1 of a 2 part Project. Initializes a UART0 of Tivia LaunchPad
to communicate with a serial terminal on a pc. Sending the characters
'r', 'g', or 'b' will turn on the on-board red, green, or blue LEDs respectively. 
SW1 of LaunchPad turns off all LEDs and outputs a confirmation message through the
serial terminal and SW2 turns on all LEDs and outputs a confirmation message through
the serial terminal.
