# UART Project Part 2
The purpose of this project was to explore the construction and 
interfacing of the UART protocol with a desktop computer.  This project 
ses two microcontroller units (MCUs) to send data overa UART protocol, 
or universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter.  This project uses two 
of the total 8 onboard hardware UARTs for the communication, and a micro 
USB interface to a desktop computer for character transmitting and receiving.
